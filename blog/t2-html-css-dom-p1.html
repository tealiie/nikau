  <h1>HTML - CSS - DOM</h1>
  <h2>26nd May 2016</h2><br><br>


  <p><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
    </strong>
    </p>
  <p>The analogy I will use correlates to application of make up. Think of HTML as the the structure of a face. Without any make up on, its very bare, you see the main structure of eyes, nose and a mouth. Just as HTML is plain text, its very basic and doesn’t stand out on a webpage. <br> 
  CSS is the style of make up you want to create, using different colour palettes, shades and techniques you can change the end result of how your face looks. So even though you have the same basic face you can have many different looks depending on how you apply the make up. So even with the same plain HTML text, you can have multiple different looking webpages depending on how you apply CSS styles. <br>
  The DOM is your face chart, which shows what colours you will use on the face and where, if you will be contouring, baking or highlighting, what brushes you’ll be using and if you’ll be adding additional extras to the structure of the face such as falsies.

  <p><strong>What is meant by boxifying design? 
    </strong>
    </p>
  <p> A webpage essentially lies on an invisible 12 column grid. Each piece of html content that can be seen on a webpage, such as text and images, is enclosed by an (invisible) box. These boxes and rectangles can be rearranged creatively anywhere on the page as long as they fit within the 12 column grid. Eg. if an image uses 9 columns in a particular row, there are only 3 columns left in that row to add any additional content. If you wanted to add something that takes up more than 3 columns you would have to place in another row on the webpage.
    </p><br>

  <p><strong>What is the box model? 
    </strong>
    </p> 
  <p>As mentioned above html content fits inside these invisible boxes. Well within those boxes, content is also surrounded by padding, border and a margin box (attributes). You can change the properties of these attributes to change how the content is displayed and viewed on the webpage. Some common change you can make on these attributes include size and colour.
