      <p class="discussion">22ND MAY 2016</p><br>
      <p><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
        </strong></p>
      <p>I have previously used Headspace for meditation and mindfulness but most of the time I fell asleep after a few minutes so I don’t think the technique worked for me. The Fogg method is quite interesting but personally not my cup of tea. I find that I can successfully change my habits by changing the environment so that I transition and flow into the new desired behaviour. Unknowingly I have used the Pomodoro technique but found that my mind will still wander and procrastinate even when given a time limit.</p><br> 

      <p><strong>What did you find interesting?
        </strong></p>
      <p> That in one form or another I’ve previously tried all the time and habits techniques mentioned. I like change so I am constantly finding new ways to experiment with my behaviour and form habits. Most techniques don’t work as I tend to get easily distracted.</p><br>

      <p><strong>What worked for you?
        </strong></p>
      <p> The growth mindset and flow. If I jump right into performing, the flow of productivity and change in behaviour naturally follows. However sometimes this can lead me down the rabbit hole and what feels like 10mins will have actually been 5 hours in real time. Therefore I find that when I make a record of how much time is spent to complete a task it makes me feel more accountable and motivates me to use my time more wisely. When I see that I spent an hour on a task that would’ve only taken 30 minutes to complete it raises red flags and indicates where I can enforce more self restraint to manage time and be more productive.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Which will you experiment further with?
        </strong></p>
      <p>I will continue working by going with the flow because it’s how I do things best. I will incorporate Toggl as a tool to measure and assess how long it takes me to complete tasks and also set up a daily schedule in my calendar to break up the work flow and allow for breaks. </p></div>
