      <p><strong>GRID - RESPONSIVE - SEMANTIC</strong></p>
      <p><strong>27TH MAY 2016</strong></p><br>
      <p><strong>What is grid based design?
        </strong></p>
      <p>Think of a webpage as essentially sitting on an invisible grid. Most grids will follow a 12 column layout because it is most flexible with rearranging content into. In a 12 column grid, in any given row content can take up 12 columns before it is pushed into the next row. This grid system makes it easier to visualise where modular contents will be placed on the page to maximise space without becoming overcrowded.
        </p><br>

      <p><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?
        </strong></p>
      <p>A webpage on a computer screen cannot be displayed in the same layout as on a smaller phone screen because the content would be too small to see, and content may run off the page. Responsive webpages allow for better viewer experience as it systemically resizes content and changes layout of a page to fit within a device’s screen.
        </p><br>
        
      <p><strong>What is semantic structure?
        </strong></p>
      <p>In HTML tags are used to identity groups of content, such as title, header, paragraphs, images. This allows for an easy to follow structure and shows the basic layout of the information. 
        </p><br>    

      <p><strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.
        </strong></p>
      <p>HTML and CSS are pretty straight forward concepts to understand, there’s just a lot of specifics to know. It’s a bit overwhelming at first, especially learning the rules of how to correctly write in HTML and what tags to use. Feeling more confident about with HTML this week than last week, so gotta dedicate time to read, read, read and watch a few videos to further my understanding.
