    <h2>Tealiie's journey into the abyss of CODE </h2><br><br><br>

      They say you know you're experiencing a mid life crisis when you suddenly find yourself driving down the road in a red sports car (even though you hate the colour red and you’re not fond of sports cars at all). And after last month’s book club reading of Eat, Pray, Love, not surprisingly you realised your biggest life regret was not finding yourself through travelling and that’s how you end up backpacking through some caves in Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily thats not me, I’m only experiencing my quarter life crisis so it’s not as expensive. 10 years ago I should’ve taken the path to study code but for whatever reason I didn’t. Thus when that clock struck midnight and the realisation of having been alive for a quarter-of-a-century and regret hit me, I knew what I had to do.

    So follow me along these 19 weeks of trial and endless error messages as I transition from novice to master coder.
